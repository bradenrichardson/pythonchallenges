# 1. Create a program which allows a user to input any cryptocurrency ticker 
# and then receive an output of TRUE or FALSE as to whether that cryptocurrency
# is below the 50 Day EMA (Exponential Moving Average)

# 2. Create a dashboard which lets you add and view tiles for different tickers,
# where the tile will tell you the ticker, the price and whether that ticker is above (exercise caution)
# or below (BTFD) the 50 Day EMA
