## How to create a challenge

1. Pull the main branch

2. Add the challenge to the recipient's readme.md file

3. Create their new challenge folder and working files (where applicable)

4. Commit and push changes to the main branch

## How to complete a challenge
1. Create a branch from Master, called your name and challenge number (ie. Ethan Challenge 1A)

2. Write your code within the challenge folder (ie. Challenge 1A), in whatever file you like, whether that's challengeXX.py (suitable for smaller functions) or your own structure (more complex projects)

3. Create a pull request, to merge your challenge branch into the main branch, and add the other housemates as reviewers

4. We will then merge or close the PR after
